            <p class="description">Armin Arlelt (アルミン・アルレルト Arumin Arureruto?) is the 15th and current commander (団長 Danchō?) of the Scout Regiment. 
                He is also a childhood friend of Eren Jaeger and Mikasa Ackermann, and is one of the two deuteragonists of the series. 
                Although he appears to be the physically weakest of the 104th Cadet Corps, his high intelligence and strategic genius makes him an invaluable asset, though he does not consider himself to be one and is known to have low self-esteem.
                 After the battle of Shiganshina District, he took the power of the Titans from Bertholdt Hoover and became the Colossal Titan.</p>

            <p class="description"> Erwin Smith (エルヴィン・スミス Eruvin Sumisu?) was the 13th commander (団長 Danchō?) of the Survey Corps. 
                Discerning, intelligent, and widely respected, Erwin was an able commander. While he cared deeply for his men,
                 he did not hesitate to sacrifice them for the good and prosperity of mankind, and his men proved more than willing to stake their lives at his order. During Erwin's career he developed the Long-Distance Enemy Scouting Formation, 
                and due to uncertainty about his future, he later named Hange Zoë as his successor.</p>
